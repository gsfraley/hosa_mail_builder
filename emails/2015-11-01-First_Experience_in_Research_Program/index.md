Good afternoon,



The First Experiences in Research Program (FE-R) is a great opportunity for Arts & Sciences students to get involved with faculty research projects in the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities as early as the spring semester of their freshman year. In this program you will perform hands on research alongside faculty members who are experts in their field for five or 10 hours each week, receiving one or two academic credits. This program often serves as a gateway to more sophisticated, independent research.



Our office has collected projects from faculty members across all schools and departments at the University- from Studio Arts & Political Science here in the School of Arts and Sciences, to Surgery and Psychiatry in the School of Medicine.



Please see the list of attached projects that we still have interview slots for. If you are interested in interviewing for any of these projects, please contact me to get the process started.



Please do not forget the importance of doing research- any research experience is valuable even if you feel that it is not in your field of study.
