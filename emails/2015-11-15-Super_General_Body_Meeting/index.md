Dear HOSA members,


Here are the updates for this week:

---

## Super General Body Meeting: Research 101

### Tuesday Nov. 17 @ 9 pm in Cathy room 324

Late November is the perfect time to be actively seeking research opportunities, both for next semester and the summer! During this meeting, we'll be working with each of you to obtain research opportunities, format emails to professors, and more! Learn from upperclassmen who have been through the process, and have succeeded in their research endeavors both at Pitt and outside during summer internships/alternative break experiences! Bring your friends and let them know about this awesome learning opportunity!


## State Conference

Our local conference was a success! Our next step is STATES! This year, states will be located in Lancaster, PA for 3 days during spring break. It's a great alternative spring break experience that will be a lot of fun! Make sure you've paid dues so that you can attend!


## Fall Food Share

On Saturday, November 21, we're having a Fall Food Share! Details to be shared at the meeting this Tuesday!

Best,

Pitt HOSA
