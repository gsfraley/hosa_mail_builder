Hey HOSA members!

Welcome back! We look forward to starting a new semester (and year) with you guys!

First of all, our STATE CONFERENCE is coming up during spring break!! Compete with HOSA members from all across Pennsylvania, win awards, and meet new friends! Remember, you must be a dues-paying member to attend. Directions for online registration are here: [http://www.pahosa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/16_DIRECTIONS_FOR_ONLINE_SLC_REGISTRATION_2.pdf](http://www.pahosa.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/16_DIRECTIONS_FOR_ONLINE_SLC_REGISTRATION_2.pdf)

Our first meeting of the semester is going to be held Tuesday, January 19th. Exact time and location will be sent out in an email closer to the meeting date. There will be FREE PIZZA!!

In addition to that, we will soon be hosting an alternate meeting time for those who are unable to attend the main meetings.  If you are unable to attend the main meetings, please fill out this Doodle indicating your availability: [http://doodle.com/poll/ze7rmn7awwdxrhhq](http://doodle.com/poll/ze7rmn7awwdxrhhq)

Lastly, we’re going to undergo some changes this semester. We’re planning on having socials for studying, conference prep, and just hanging out and meeting fellow HOSA members. Additionally, we’re going to adopt an attendance point system. You’ll earn points from going to meetings, events, and socials and the points go towards the state conference and the national conference during the summer!

That’s it for our updates for the week! Have a great semester!
Best,
HOSA
