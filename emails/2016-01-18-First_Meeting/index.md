Hey HOSA members!

We’re going to be kicking off the new semester with FREE PIZZA at our first meeting tomorrow! Come to Cathy room 302 at 9 pm on Tuesday, January 19th. We’re going to be discussing the details of our state conference so it is very important for you to attend if you are interested in competing!

Additionally, we are introducing an attendance point system–you will need a minimum of 10 points to compete at the state conference–so bring your friends and come to as many meetings as possible!

Lastly, if you have not signed up for a committee yet, make sure to follow this link! [http://goo.gl/forms/58M11ujgrb](http://goo.gl/forms/58M11ujgrb).

That’s it for now! See you the meeting tomorrow! (Come hungry)

Best,
HOSA
