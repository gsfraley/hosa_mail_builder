Come speak with our panel of pre-health students for advice, receive OCC credit, practice for state and national competitions, have a chance at winning a free HOSA t-shirt, and eat tons of pizzaâ€“on us!


Dress code is business casual. Feel free to email us if you have any questions. Hope to see everyone there!
