Hello HOSA members!

Here's a few updates just in case you missed the meeting Tuesday:

---

## Conference Postponed
Unfortunately, we had to postpone our local conference due to conflicts with homecoming weekend activities. Our new conference date is <b>November 7th from 10 am to 3 pm in room 537 at WPU</b>! Join us and bring your friends!

## Dues
If you still haven't paid your dues, please turn them in by our next meeting at *9 pm on October 20th in room 324 of the Cathedral of Learning.*

Best,
